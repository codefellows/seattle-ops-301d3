# Network Segmentation

By designing a network to control how traffic flows among its parts, we can achieve network segmentation. Benefits of segmentation include improvements to operational perfomance, reduction of cyber attack surface, additional protection for vulnerable devices, and a reduction in scope of regulatory compliance. Today you will practice designing a network to achieve a specified segmentation requirement.
