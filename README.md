# Ops 301 Required Downloads

All required downloads of large files will be listed here to help you prepare for each class lab activity. 
- For ISO files, you don't need to download more than one copy to a local computer. Many of these you likely already have saved locally if you completed Ops 201.
- Unlike Ops 201, we'll be deploying much of our infrastructure from scratch (installation disc ISO). There will be no premade OVA scenarios for you to download in this class.
