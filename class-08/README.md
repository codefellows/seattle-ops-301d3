# Routing

Enterprise network administrators use routing skills to handle large and complex multi-router topologies or connections. ISP backbone routers can and do malfunction on occasion, causing routing problems for everyday users. Routing issues can also arise when configuring VPN tunnelling between two complex LANs. 

Routing is a fundamental mechanic in the overall operations of not only networks but the internet at large. In today's lab you'll practice configuring BGP on two routers.
